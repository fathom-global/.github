## Review Instructions

[A useful general guide on what to look for in code review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html).

Below are Fathom's specific expectations.

### Required

- Read through the code changes and check that the docs, README and existing tests have been updated.
- Check that the code is readable and easy to understand. This includes: comments, variable names, method names and line length.
- Check that the code meets the requirements specified in the PR description and/or linked ClickUp ticket.
- Verify that all automated checks pass

### Recommended Best Practices

- Verify that all new code is covered by corresponding tests.
- No file paths are hardcoded in the main body of the file. Try using parameter file or input arguments instead.

### Going the Extra Mile

- Checkout the code locally, try running the new code yourself and verify that it runs as you expect.
